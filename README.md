# Sections in your code

Sections will allow you to create sections in your dart code files and quickly navigate between them.

### There are two ways to create a section:

###### The simple way

```
/// [section_title]
```

This will create a new title in the **_sections in your file_** window of your visual studio code.

###### With sub-sections

```
/// [header/subsection_title]
```

With this syntax you will create a section that can contain other subsections
